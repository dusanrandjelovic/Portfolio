  <h1>How I Started</h1>
    <div class="col">
  <p class="preko">Without any knowledge of coding, about programming, without any knowledge of
    website creation, I needed to have some clear goal about what I want to learn.
    This goal was: I want to make a website. With research, firstly, I came to
    WordPress, free website builder. With WordPress I made couple of websites.
    Because those sites are tottaly free (free domain name and hosting), they have
    subdomain .wordpress and some of them have advertisement for WordPress on their
    pages. But when site was finished, he was not visible on google search. Then, I
    found that I need to submit URL of my website to google. After that, my site is
    visible. Nine of my WordPress websites, that I made, are on first google page
    after search, without typing subdomain .wordpress. You only need to type, for
    example, mlekara mlecni zalogaj, and you will see this site on first google page.
    Also, you can type informalno ucenje, and for now, second and third result are my
    sites. One coded in Atom code editor, other done in WordPress.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col">
  <p class="preko">My first goal was accomplished. Second goal was: I want to code site.
    With research, I found W3schools, freeCodeCamp, codecademy, free platforms
    for learning. I learned HTML5 and CSS3, Bootstrap, and when I started with
    JavaScript and jQuery, I had first problems to understand how to implement theory
    in practice. In CodePen I made first sites by coding. But, CodePen is working
    platform and sites are not visible on google search. I realised that I need code
    editor and host. I downloaded Atom, free code editor and made files with HTML5 and
    CSS3. I chose 000webhost to host my sites and simply copy/pasted files on required
    space on my 000webhost profile. I did not need Filezile. Three sites that I coded,
    are part of world wide web: informalno ucenje, serbian dogs, prirodnjacki centar
    sumarak. But, problem with free 000webhost hosting is: suffix on domain name
    .000webhostapp; 4 hours a day site is sleeping; there are advertisements on site pages.  </p>
