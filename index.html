    <p>I am an amateur in creating websites. For this purpose, I am using basic things: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and little JavaScript. Maybe my sites are not some "supersites", but they are functional and well designed. I like coding and playing with text, pictures, colors. <br /><br />
      In the examples, you can see what I have done. I am coding in CodePen, Atom (free editor) and I am creating websites in WordPress (free version). I am using free domain names and free hosting. So my sites, who are visible on Google search, have some suffix in their name and advertisements on their pages.</p>

          <p>I have Master's degree in Adult Education. Because my average mark was 9.50 and through studies I finished professional practice and held number's of presentations and workshops, my principle was: 'I do not need any more volunteering. I do not need to work for free to gain experience.' But reality is different. Then, I started learning web development. Where I do not have diploma and where is normal to exist doubt about my knowledge, so here, practice is reality. <p/>
